## Computer Technology Over the Years and its Improvements

 ### Factors of Improvement 
- Semiconductor Technology Improvements
    - Lead to Size Decrease of Chips
    - Improved Clock Cycle per Seconds capaabilites
- Compiler Improvements
    - Improvement in tHLL Compiler, UNIX
    - Lead to RISC Architecture

There was too much stuff about the improvement in the years... we have come so far and there is still a journey ahead

### Current Trends in Architecture
+ The Instruction Level Parallelism (IlP) that was there before is not compatible with multi-processing systems, it was meant for single-core architecture.
+ New Models for Performance
    - Data Level Parallelism (DLP)
    - Thread Level Parallelism (TLP)
    - Request Level Parallelism (RLP)
