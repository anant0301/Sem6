Lab Statement
"
Today LAB practice on ADC to digital conversion. Those who has TM4C123GH6PM board can do practically. Those who have no board can calculate the sample corresponding voltage, and draw a characteristic graph between voltage vs sample. Implementation and experimental output i have given in the recorded video.
