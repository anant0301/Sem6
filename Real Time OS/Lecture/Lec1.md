- What is a real-time system? 
    - Real time is a quatitative notion of time measure in a physical clock.
    - Just to give an example of a real time system let us say that in a chemical reactor if the temperature exceeds 500 degrees, then the coolant shower must be turned down within 100 milliseconds. So, here once the temperature exceeds 500 degrees then we need to set a physical clockand then check whether the coolant shower is actually getting on within 100 millisecond otherwise the system would be considered as failed.

- How is a real-time operating system different from a traditional operating system? 

    - The traditional operating system in contrast is that we would prefer more of 'qualitive notion' (or reference) of time like the terms before, after, sometime would suggest.
    - Here in RTOS there are events occuring and there must be events occuring and with respect to these events there are some time constraints called __Time constraint Response to the event__.
- What are embedded systems? 

- What are the different types of real-time tasks?
