* >manufacturing products (finished goods)
* >agricultural products (raw materials)
*  < < <core product (why should buyer have the product)> Actual Product/ tangible specs (color, weight, capacity, price)> Augmented features (name, brand, packaging, warranty)>
5 product levels by Philip Kotler : 
*  < < < < < core benefit > generic product > expected product > augmented product > potential product >
*  Nokia was the dominant phone <- Not anymore because of several changes in market

Key Differences between services
* goods are material items that customers buy for a price 0000 Services are amenities, benefits or facilities provided by others
* goods are tangible (not alwats tho)
* ownership of services are non-transferable
*  Evaluation of services is very difficult because every service provider has a different approach of carrying out services, so its hard to judge whose services are better
*  Goods can be returned or exchanged but not services
